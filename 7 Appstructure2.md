Here's a **detailed explanation for each language**, showing how apps are typically structured and how to write a Dockerfile for them. These examples are beginner-friendly and production-aware.

---

## 🐍 1. Python

### ✅ Common App Structure:

```
my-python-app/
├── app.py
├── requirements.txt
```

### ✅ `requirements.txt`:

Contains Python libraries:

```txt
flask==2.3.2
requests==2.31.0
```

### ✅ Dockerfile:

```dockerfile
# Base image
FROM python:3.11-slim

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy dependency file and install
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Copy source code
COPY . .

# Start app
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

> 💡 Use Flask or FastAPI for web apps. Add port `EXPOSE 5000` if needed.

---

## ☕ 2. Java (Maven)

### ✅ Common App Structure:

```
my-java-app/
├── pom.xml
└── src/
    └── main/
        └── java/
            └── App.java
```

### ✅ Dockerfile (multi-stage):

```dockerfile
# Stage 1: Build
FROM maven:3.9-eclipse-temurin-17 AS builder
WORKDIR /build
COPY pom.xml .
COPY src ./src
RUN mvn clean package

# Stage 2: Run
FROM eclipse-temurin:17-jdk
COPY --from=builder /build/target/*.jar /app.jar
CMD ["java", "-jar", "/app.jar"]
```

> 💡 Replace `*.jar` with actual name like `app-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar` if not generic.

---

## 🌐 3. Node.js

### ✅ Common App Structure:

```
my-node-app/
├── app.js
├── package.json
├── package-lock.json
```

### ✅ Dockerfile:

```dockerfile
FROM node:20
WORKDIR /app

# Install dependencies
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install

# Copy source code
COPY . .

# Expose port (optional for web apps)
EXPOSE 3000

# Start app
CMD ["node", "app.js"]
```

> 💡 For frameworks like Express or NestJS, entry point might differ.

---

## 🦫 4. Go (Golang)

### ✅ Common App Structure:

```
my-go-app/
├── main.go
├── go.mod
```

### ✅ Dockerfile (multi-stage):

```dockerfile
# Stage 1: Build
FROM golang:1.21 AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN go build -o myapp

# Stage 2: Run
FROM alpine:latest
COPY --from=builder /app/myapp /myapp
CMD ["/myapp"]
```

> 💡 This results in a small container (\~10MB). Perfect for microservices.

---

## 🟣 5. .NET Core

### ✅ Common App Structure:

```
my-dotnet-app/
├── YourApp.csproj
├── Program.cs
├── Startup.cs
```

### ✅ Dockerfile (multi-stage):

```dockerfile
# Build Stage
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:8.0 AS build
WORKDIR /src
COPY . .
RUN dotnet publish -c Release -o /app

# Runtime Stage
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:8.0
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=build /app .
ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "YourApp.dll"]
```

> 💡 Replace `YourApp.dll` with your actual DLL output name.

---

## 💎 6. Ruby on Rails

### ✅ Common App Structure:

```
my-rails-app/
├── Gemfile
├── config/
├── app/
```

### ✅ Dockerfile:

```dockerfile
FROM ruby:3.2
WORKDIR /app

# Install dependencies
COPY Gemfile* ./
RUN bundle install

# Copy app
COPY . .

# Start Rails server
CMD ["rails", "server", "-b", "0.0.0.0"]
```

> 💡 Add Node.js/Yarn if using Webpacker: `RUN curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_20.x | bash - && apt install -y nodejs`

---

## 🐘 7. PHP (Laravel)

### ✅ Common App Structure:

```
my-laravel-app/
├── index.php
├── composer.json
├── public/
```

### ✅ Dockerfile:

```dockerfile
FROM php:8.2-apache
COPY . /var/www/html

# Install extensions
RUN docker-php-ext-install pdo pdo_mysql

# Enable Apache mod_rewrite for Laravel
RUN a2enmod rewrite
```

> 💡 Also consider using Laravel Sail or a PHP-FPM + Nginx setup for production.

---

## 📦 Docker Compose Example (Node.js + MongoDB)

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  app:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    depends_on:
      - mongo
  mongo:
    image: mongo:6
    ports:
      - "27017:27017"
```

Would you like me to generate a GitHub-ready folder structure with Dockerfiles for all these languages? Or would you prefer Kubernetes YAMLs as the next step?
