Here’s a comprehensive list of **Docker interview questions and answers for DevOps roles**, divided into **basic**, **intermediate**, and **advanced** levels — including **scenario-based questions** frequently asked in DevOps interviews.

---

### 🟢 **Basic Docker Questions**

#### 1. **What is Docker?**

**Answer:** Docker is an open-source containerization platform that allows you to package applications and their dependencies into containers. These containers are portable and run consistently across different environments.

---

#### 2. **What is a Docker container?**

**Answer:** A container is a lightweight, standalone, executable package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software — code, runtime, system tools, libraries, and settings.

---

#### 3. **What is the difference between Docker containers and virtual machines (VMs)?**

**Answer:**

| Docker Container     | Virtual Machine    |
| -------------------- | ------------------ |
| Shares OS kernel     | Has its own OS     |
| Lightweight and fast | Heavy and slow     |
| Uses fewer resources | Resource-intensive |

---

#### 4. **What is Dockerfile?**

**Answer:** A Dockerfile is a text file that contains a set of instructions to build a Docker image. It defines what goes into the container, such as base image, environment variables, commands, etc.

---

#### 5. **What is a Docker image?**

**Answer:** An image is a lightweight, immutable template used to create containers. It is built using a Dockerfile and contains the application and its environment.

---

### 🟡 **Intermediate Docker Questions**

#### 6. **What is the difference between `CMD` and `ENTRYPOINT` in Dockerfile?**

**Answer:**

* `CMD`: Provides default arguments for the container.
* `ENTRYPOINT`: Defines the main command to run inside the container.
* They can be combined for flexibility.

---

#### 7. **How do you persist data in Docker?**

**Answer:** By using **Volumes** or **Bind Mounts**.

* **Volumes**: Managed by Docker, recommended for production.
* **Bind Mounts**: Map host file system directories into containers.

---

#### 8. **How do you expose a port in Docker?**

**Answer:** Use the `-p` flag in `docker run`, like:

```bash
docker run -p 8080:80 nginx
```

This maps port 80 inside the container to port 8080 on the host.

---

#### 9. **How do you copy files into a Docker container?**

**Answer:** Using `COPY` or `ADD` in Dockerfile, or

```bash
docker cp myfile.txt container_id:/app/
```

---

#### 10. **What is Docker Compose?**

**Answer:** Docker Compose is a tool to define and run multi-container Docker applications using a `docker-compose.yml` file. It simplifies the orchestration of services, networks, and volumes.

---

### 🔴 **Advanced Docker Questions**

#### 11. **How do you optimize Docker images for production?**

**Answer:**

* Use minimal base images (like `alpine`)
* Combine `RUN` commands
* Use `.dockerignore`
* Clean up unnecessary files (e.g., apt caches)
* Use multi-stage builds

---

#### 12. **What are multi-stage builds in Docker?**

**Answer:** Multi-stage builds help reduce image size by using intermediate containers to build dependencies, and then copying only necessary files into the final image.

```Dockerfile
FROM golang:alpine AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN go build -o app

FROM alpine
COPY --from=builder /app/app .
CMD ["./app"]
```

---

#### 13. **How do you handle secret management in Docker?**

**Answer:**

* Avoid adding secrets directly into images.
* Use environment variables or Docker secrets (in Swarm).
* Use tools like HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager.

---
In our organization, we use AWS Secrets Manager and AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store to securely manage and access secrets.

🔐 AWS Secrets Manager:
We use it to store sensitive information like database credentials, API keys, and third-party service tokens. Here's the typical workflow:

Store the Secret:

We create secrets using the AWS Console, CLI, or IaC (e.g., Terraform).

Secrets are stored with automatic versioning and optional rotation.

Access from Application (inside container):

The application container is deployed on EKS or ECS.

It assumes an IAM role (via IRSA or task role) that has permission to access the secret.

At runtime, the app fetches the secret using AWS SDK (e.g., Boto3 for Python, AWS SDK for Go/Java).

Optionally, secrets can be mounted as environment variables or injected at startup via an init container or sidecar pattern.

🧩 AWS Parameter Store (SSM):
We use Parameter Store for less sensitive configuration values like feature flags, environment settings, and region values.

Parameter Types:

Standard parameters: Non-sensitive config (e.g., /app/env/region)

SecureString parameters: Encrypted values (e.g., /app/db/password)

Access in Containers:

The container uses the AWS SDK or AWS CLI to fetch parameters.

IAM roles are tightly scoped to allow access only to specific parameter paths.

✅ Best Practices We Follow:
Secrets and parameters are never hardcoded or baked into images.

IAM roles follow principle of least privilege.

Secrets rotation is enabled for RDS and other services.

Caching layer (e.g., sidecar or in-memory) is sometimes used to reduce API calls.

Let me know if you'd like a sample code or IAM policy snippet for accessing secrets.

#### 14. **What is the difference between `docker stop` and `docker kill`?**

**Answer:**

* `docker stop`: Sends `SIGTERM`, allows graceful shutdown.
* `docker kill`: Sends `SIGKILL`, forcefully terminates the container.

---

#### 15. **How do you troubleshoot a failing Docker container?**

**Answer:**

* `docker ps -a` to see status
* `docker logs <container>` to view logs
* `docker inspect <container>` for config/debug info
* `docker exec -it <container> sh` to access the container shell

---

### 🧩 **Scenario-Based Docker Questions**

#### 16. **Your container keeps restarting. How do you investigate the cause?**

**Answer:**

* Check `docker ps -a` for restart reason.
* View logs using `docker logs <container>`.
* Use `docker inspect` to view restart policies.
* Verify entrypoint or CMD is valid.

#### 17. **You want to deploy a Python app with Redis and Nginx in Docker. How would you set it up?**

**Answer:** Use Docker Compose:

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  app:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
    depends_on:
      - redis
  redis:
    image: redis:alpine
  nginx:
    image: nginx
    ports:
      - "80:80"
    volumes:
      - ./nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf
```

---

#### 18. **How do you ensure zero downtime deployments using Docker?**

**Answer:**

* Use rolling updates (in Swarm or Kubernetes)
* Load balancers with health checks
* Run new containers before stopping old ones

---

#### 19. **You need to reduce the Docker image size of a Node.js app. What steps will you take?**

**Answer:**

* Use `node:alpine` base image
* Remove dev dependencies
* Use `.dockerignore`
* Use multi-stage builds

---

#### 20. **How would you patch a container running in production without redeploying?**

**Answer:**

* Use `docker exec` to access and apply temporary fixes
* Commit changes using `docker commit` (not recommended for long-term)
* Best practice: Update Dockerfile → rebuild → redeploy
